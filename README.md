 Power Demand Forecasting using LSTM

This project focuses on forecasting electrical power demand using a 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which is well-suited for 
time series prediction problems.

# Objective
To predict future power demand based on historical consumption data.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

# Dataset
The dataset contains historical power consumption values recorded at 
regular time intervals.

# Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and normalization
2. Creation of time-series sequences
3. LSTM model construction
4. Model training and validation
5. Forecasting future demand

# Model Architecture
- LSTM layer(s)
- Dense output layer
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
- Adam optimizer

# Results
The trained model successfully captures temporal dependencies and 
provides accurate power demand forecasts.

# How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/power-demand-forecasting-lstm.git
